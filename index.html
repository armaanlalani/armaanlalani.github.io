            <p class="paragraph">I engaged in a number of Microsoft courses pertaining to machine learning and data analysis through the courses Principles of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Image Analysis, SQL for Data Science, and Data Science: R Basics.</p>
            <p class="course">Principles of Machine Learning - Provided me with a comprehensive overview of a number of methods to develop and enhance machine learning algorithms. I was introduced to data preparation by importing large excel or csv files into a pandas data frame and making the necessary adjustments to prepare the dataset by removing redundancies, outliers, and irrelevant data. I was then introduced to supervised machine learning using both linear regression and classification and methods to improve model performance through cross validation and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, I was introduced to a number of advanced algorithms such as decisions trees and forests, neural networks, and Bayes Theorem. Finally, I worked with unsupervised machine learning algorithms using various clustering techniques. To complete the course, I developed my own machine learning algorithm to predict customer behaviour from a very large customer dataset regarding the purchase of a bike as well as their average monthly spending. <a href="https://github.com/armaanlalani/ML_Customer_Behaviour" target="_blank">Click on this link</a> to view my project on Github.</p>
            <p class="course">Computer Vision and Image Analysis - An introduction to a number of topics related to image analysis such as applying filters to images to enhance certain aspects that require emphasis and morphology. I also utilized convolutional neural networks to categorize images based on a trained dataset and YOLO and UNET architecture to perform object recognition and segmentation.</p>
            <p class="course">SQL for Data Science - This was a course offered by IBM which provided an introduction to running SQL Queries as well as how to use IBM Cloud. After learning about running SQL Queries, I connected to an online database hosted by IBM Cloud using Python. I was then able to run SQL queries directly from Python and manipulate the particular dataset that was stored on the IBM DB2 Cloud database.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In response to COVID-19 preventing the completion of the Praxis III project, individual projects were completed instead. The project consisted of using PID control to maintain straight line motion of a simulated robot. The simulation consisted of the motion of the two wheels, one of which was simulated to be slightly faster than the other while also allowing noise to effect the robot's motion. I was able to successfully implement PID control to maintain a straight trajectory of the robot while also using compass control to further enhance its behaviour.

            <p class="paragraph">The basis of this course consisted of designing an autonomous robot, rover, etc. that could successfully deliver a charger to an electric car. The design had to follow certain restraints pertaining to setup, size restrictions, and power restrictions, however there was room for creativity in tackling this challenge. My team designed a rover that was capable of moving along the floor while also making use of a lead screw to provide motion in the z direction needed to reach charging ports of various heights.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was responsible for implementing Arduino code to allow for our robot to interact with its surroundings as well as design the primary layout of our robot prior to building it using CAD through Fusion.

            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">I competed in the U of T Biomedical Engineering Competition with a group of three other students in Engineering Science. In 2019, the competition called for participants to design a solution to improve the quality of life of children suffering from Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis (CIPA) which is an extremely rare condition preventing the sensation of pain and temperature. This can often lead to children harming themselves unknowlingly leading to early deaths. The competition consisted of a conducting research and developing a presentation about the proposed solution and first presenting it to the competition coordinators followed by industry experts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My team and I recognized from the beginning that several teams would attempt to implement monitoring systems to prevent children from interacting with anything that could be potentially dangerous if their parents are not around. My team and I decided to take a different approach by completing extensive research around Liquid Crystalline Elastomers (LCEs). LCEs are biomaterials that can change form base on temperature. My team and I decided to use these materials to build LCE utensils which would change form if a particular food was either too hot or too cold. For example, if a child with CIPA places their spoon in soup that would burn their palates, the spoon after being exposed to this liquid would change shape making it effectively unusable and preventing the child from consuming the soup. Visit the link below for more information on the project.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The projects completed during Praxis II were extremely rigorous and focused primarily on the engineering design process. The first half of the course involved reaching out to a particular community and recognizing an opportunity to utilize the engineering design process to positively impact some aspect of that community. Within a group of four, we visited Out of the Cold, an initiative that allows homeless people to spend a night at a local church during winter months. My team and I had the opportunity to perform a site visit while interacting with many of the staff and residents to gain a better understanding of their operations. Following a site visit and extensive research, my team and I wrote a Request for Proposal centered around security and comfort for temporary residents of the churches.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The second half of the course involved targetting a specific RFP chosen by course instructors. My team and I chose to look into the issue of collecting shuttlecocks at a local badminton club after individual drills. The process of picking up all the shuttlecocks by hand is extremely time consuming and often limits practice time of members of the club. Keeping this issue in mind as well as the various restraints set out in the RFP, my team and I decided to create a machine that would be pushed along the ground and gather shuttlecocks as it moved. This design decision was supported by research and a site visit and was eventually presented to course instructors and TA's.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The construction of our mechanism assisted me in developing a number of important skills including:</p>
            <ul class="listup">
              <li class="list"><h5 id="subtitle2" class="titles">Mechanical Design</h5>The entire mechanism was built using mainly wood and glue. The design required a very high degree of precision as it needed to travel seamlessly on the ground which was acheived using laser cuts and CAD.</li>
              <li class="list"><h5 id="subtitle2" class="titles">CAD</h5>Working on this project first exposed me to CAD and 3D printing which were extremely beneficial skills for projects to follow.</li>

            <p class="paragraph">My first major univesity project was developing a Chess AI using Python. I first developed the framework for the game using an array as the board and defined the movements which were legal for a player to choose. This led to a very simple 1 vs. 1 game of chess with both check and checkmate analysis. Following this, I began to develop an AI using tree structures in Python. The initial node of the tree was the current state of the board which went down a few levels based on the various moves that could be made by the computer. The computer would determine the best move to make based on a number of criteria and would move accordingly.</p>
