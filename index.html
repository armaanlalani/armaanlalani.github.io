            <span id="more_op">
              <p class="paragraph" id="more4p">I had the tremendous opportunity to work at OPTrust during my Professional Experience Year (PEY) as a CMG Investment Co-op on the TFCPS team. My role and team was heavily focused on making strong data driven investment decisions using a variety of techniques from the fields of data science and machine learning. A few of my most meaningful projects included building an equity regime detection model, a bootstrapping model to analyze the performance of various risk mitigants against the S&P, and a neural network to predict the price of movements of various future rolls.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="paragraph" id="more4p">The equity regime detection model consisted of two parts: the first was utilizing L1 trend filtering to numerically identify historical periods of growth and decline in equity and secondly, training a random forest model of several macroeconomic indicators to predict regime switches. The model performed well out of sample, and was able to predict the switch of regimes during the Global Financial Crisis as well as COVID. The model will continue to be used in production for Severe Market Decline and Systematic Risk Allocation. The bootstrapping model I built was used to test the effectiveness of various risk mitigating strategies against the S&P. The model samples historical returns to create a simulated path environment for a specified amount of time. It then introduces a risk mitigant (gold, bonds, currencies, etc.) or a particular strategy (trend, options, etc.) to attempt to reduce the VAR95 of the original portfolio by a certain percentage. This model is now currently being used by the investment division to test the effectiveness of various strategies. Lastly, I also built a convolutional neural network to predict price movements of futures rolls. I was responsible for creating the entire data pipeline, consisting of extracting the appropriate roll tickers based on the roll schedule, querying Bloomberg for price, volume, open interest, and commitment of traderâ€™s data, and performing data preprocessing to ensure it could be passed through a model. The model did not perform as well as expected, however, the project provided me with important information regarding the process of rolling futures and the various capabilities offered by the Bloomberg terminal.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="paragraph" id="more4p">Finally, I also worked on a number of reporting projects during my time at OPTrust. Some of these included generating and sending out reports daily on FX Exposure and P&L, analyzing model slippage of Risk Reduced Equities using intraday data, and generating reporting emails for various fund portfolios.</p>

              <p class="paragraph" id="more1p">During the 2021-2022 academic year, I worked as a Project Developer for UTMIST. The project my team and I worked on was developing an image to text converter in Python and I was specifically tasked with implementing the sentence to word segmentation feature. By utilizing the IAM Dataset, I was able to generate a dataloader class which consisted of various examples of handwritten lines along with the bounding boxes associated with each individual word. By utilizing resnet architecture, I was able to reconstruct an existing model to train. During the training process, the model was not able to converge to locating the ground truth bounding boxes, and as a result, we proceeded to use a pretrained model. The pretrained model was able to locate the bounding boxes accurately on the dataloader class that was built and was used in the final pipeline.

              <p class="paragraph">Data Collection: The data collection process consisted of us collecting 30 second samples of various songs belonging to 7 genres of music. This was done using the Spotify API, the package youtube_dl, and a script that collected a random 30 second sample of the mp3 files. Following this, we utilized the library librosa to convert each 30 second sample into a mel-spectrogram (essentially an image representation of a music file in the frequency domain) which would then be passed through a neural network for training.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Model Architecture: I lead the effort to design the models used for training, which consisted of a baseline CNN model, a more advanced CNN model, and finally a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) model. Based on hyperparameter optimization, we were able to acheieve a test accuracy of roughly 79% compared to just 14% of guessing considering there were 7 music genres used.

              <p class="paragraph">The course Introduction to Image Analysis provided me with the opportunity to collaborate with two peers on reconstructing a 3D model from various 2D images. There was flexibility on how we chose to tackle this problem, and we originally researched using neural networks. However, there were various issues with this method including lack of an appropriate dataset containing both 2D images and 3D models and ground truth approximations using voxels would have been extremely difficult.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">As a result, our team pivoted to implementing reconstruction using stereo vision. This was done by applying various techniques including image rectification, developing disparity maps, utilizing epipoles, generating depth maps, and several others. This was done as a result of utilizing OpenCV functions as well as developing some of our own to assist with debugging. While the end result was not the most accurate, the project provided me with the opportuntiy to consolidate various techniques learned throughout the semester and enhanced my ability in utilizing OpenCV.

              <p class="paragraph">I competed in the U of T Biomedical Engineering Competition with a group of three other students in Engineering Science. In 2019, the competition called for participants to design a solution to improve the quality of life of children suffering from Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis (CIPA) which is an extremely rare condition preventing the sensation of pain and temperature. This can often lead to children harming themselves unknowlingly leading to early deaths. The competition consisted of a conducting research and developing a presentation about the proposed solution and first presenting it to the competition coordinators followed by industry experts.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">My team and I recognized from the beginning that several teams would attempt to implement monitoring systems to prevent children from interacting with anything that could be potentially dangerous if their parents are not around. My team and I decided to take a different approach by completing extensive research around Liquid Crystalline Elastomers (LCEs). LCEs are biomaterials that can change form base on temperature. My team and I decided to use these materials to build LCE utensils which would change form if a particular food was either too hot or too cold. For example, if a child with CIPA places their spoon in soup that would burn their palates, the spoon after being exposed to this liquid would change shape making it effectively unusable and preventing the child from consuming the soup.

              <p class="paragraph">The projects completed during Praxis II were extremely rigorous and focused primarily on the engineering design process. The first half of the course involved reaching out to a particular community and recognizing an opportunity to utilize the engineering design process to positively impact some aspect of that community. Within a group of four, we visited Out of the Cold, an initiative that allows homeless people to spend a night at a local church during winter months. My team and I had the opportunity to perform a site visit while interacting with many of the staff and residents to gain a better understanding of their operations. Following a site visit and extensive research, my team and I wrote a Request for Proposal centered around security and comfort for temporary residents of the churches.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">The second half of the course involved targetting a specific RFP chosen by course instructors. My team and I chose to look into the issue of collecting shuttlecocks at a local badminton club after individual drills. The process of picking up all the shuttlecocks by hand is extremely time consuming and often limits practice time of members of the club. Keeping this issue in mind as well as the various restraints set out in the RFP, my team and I decided to create a machine that would be pushed along the ground and gather shuttlecocks as it moved. This design decision was supported by research and a site visit and was eventually presented to course instructors and TA's.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The construction of our mechanism assisted me in developing a number of important skills including:</p>
              <ul class="listup">
                <li class="list"><h5 id="subtitle2" class="titles">Mechanical Design</h5>The entire mechanism was built using mainly wood and glue. The design required a very high degree of precision as it needed to travel seamlessly on the ground which was acheived using laser cuts and CAD.</li>
                <li class="list"><h5 id="subtitle2" class="titles">CAD</h5>Working on this project first exposed me to CAD and 3D printing which were extremely beneficial skills for projects to follow.</li>
